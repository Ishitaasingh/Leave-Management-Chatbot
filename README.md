# Leave-Management-Chatbot
A chatbot that makes it easier for an employee to request for a leave.It fetches the data from the database and updates it.
Chatbots are designed to simulate how a person would respond as a conversational partner. Chatbots are used for practical purposes in dialog systems, including customer services or any kind of inquiry services.
This primarily utilizes machine learning concepts, i.e. Natural Language Processing that could be used to create an interface based on a simple pattern to help the user with leave application request.
Considering the scale of employees working in an organization, it becomes a tedious task for the organization to manage the leaves available to them and consumes a lot of time.
In this paper a chatbot using NLP has been used with the company database to process the leave application of the employees. It not only utilizes the time of the managers but reduce the manpower requirement for this job by keeping a tab of this management process. The designed application was also expected to make this entire process interactive and user-friendly, with lesser maintenance requirements and chances of error.
Chatbot style interface have a lot of potential in interactive systems to gain information from the users.

MODULES USED:
 
●	NLTK
NLTK is a platform for building programs in python to work along human language data. It provides easy interfaces along with text processing libraries for tokenization, classification, tagging, semantic reasoning, parsing and wrappers for industrial NLP libraries. It’s suitable for students, engineers, educators, industry users and researchers. It provides a practical introduction towards language processing programming.
 
●	Pyodbc
Pyodbc in python is an open source module that makes it simple to access ODBC databases. It implements the Python DB API 2.0 specification. Python DB API defines database neutral interface to data that is stored in relational databases. Pyodbc is a conformant module for ODBC databases.
 
●	__future__
This module makes one accustomed to incompatible changes or the ones introducing new keywords.
Future statements are special as they change how a module in python is parsed. That’s the reason they are present at the top of the script. They are known to provide different meaning to symbols and words in the file. It is a directive to the compiler specifying that the specific module should be compiled using semantics and syntax that may be made available in future python versions. It makes it possible to use new features on a per-module basis before the actual release. It is a pseudo module which can be used to enable different language features which may not be compatible with the interpreter that is currently being used.
